<h2>1. <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>olap4j is an open Java API for building OLAP applications.</p>

<p>In essence, olap4j is to multidimensional data JDBC is for relational data.
olap4j has a similar programming model to JDBC, shares some of its core classes,
and has many of the same advantages. You can write an OLAP application in Java
for one
server (say Mondrian) and easily switch it to another (say Microsoft Analysis
Services, accessed via XML for Analysis).</p>

<p>However, creating a standard OLAP API for Java is a contentious issue. To
understand why, it helps to understand the history of OLAP standards.</p>

<h3>1.1. <a name="A_brief_history_of_OLAP_standards">A brief history of OLAP standards</a></h3>

<p>History is strewn with attempts to create a standard OLAP API. First, the OLAP council's
MDAPI (in two versions), then the JOLAP API emerged from Sun's Java Community
Process. These all failed, it seems, because at some point during the
committee stages, all of the OLAP server vendors concerned lost
interest in releasing an implementation of the standard. The standards were
large and complex, and no
user-interface provider stepped forward with a UI which worked with multiple
back-ends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft introduced OLE DB for OLAP (which works only between
Windows clients and servers), and then XML/A (XML for Analysis, a web-services
API). These standards were more successful, for a variety of reasons. First,
since the standards (OLE DB for OLAP in particular) were mainly driven by one
vendor, they were not a compromise attempting to encompass the functionality of
several products. Second, there was a ready reference implementation, and
Microsoft saw to it that there were sufficient OLAP clients to make these
standards viable forums for competition and innovation. Third, there was the MDX
query language. A query language is easier to explain than an API. It leaves
unsolved the problem of how to construct queries to answer business questions,
but application developers could solve that problem by embedding one of the
off-the-shelf OLAP clients.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Open Source community has been developing a taste for OLAP. First there was Mondrian, an open-source OLAP
server; then there was JPivot, a client which first spoke to Mondrian, then also
to XML/A; then there were more OLAP clients, and applications which wanted to
use a particular client, but wanted to talk to a variety of servers; and
companies using a particular OLAP server that wanted to get at it from several
clients. It became clear the open-source OLAP tools needed a standard, and that
standard would probably be suitable for other Java-based OLAP tools.</p>

<h3>1.2. <a name="Overview_of_olap4j">Overview of olap4j</a></h3>

<p>An OLAP application interacts with an OLAP server by means of MDX statements
belonging to connections. The statements are defined in terms of metadata and
validated according to a type system, and some applications are built at a
higher level, manipulating MDX parse trees, and defining complex queries in
terms that a business user can understand. The olap4j API provides all of these
facilities.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, olap4j has a framework for registering <b>drivers</b>,
and managing the lifecycle of <b>connections and statements</b>. olap4j provides
this support by extending the JDBC framework.</p>

<p>A key decision in the design of an OLAP API is whether to include a <b>query
language</b>. Historically, it has been a contentious one. The previous
standards fell into two camps: MDAPI and JOLAP had an API for building queries,
while OLE DB for OLAP and XML/A had the MDX query language. The SQL query
language is an essential component of relational database APIs such as ODBC and
JDBC, and it makes similar sense to base an OLAP API on a query language such as
MDX. But OLAP applications also need to <b>build and transform queries</b> as
the end-user explores the data. So, olap4j embraces both approaches: you can
create a query by parsing an MDX statement, you can build a query by
manipulating an MDX parse tree, and an MDX parser library allows you to easily
convert an MDX string to and from a parse tree.</p>

<p><b>Metadata </b>is at the heart of olap4j. You can browse the cubes,
dimensions, hierarchies, members in an OLAP schema, and an MDX parse tree and
query result are tied back to the same metadata objects. There is also a <b>type
system </b>for describing expressions.</p>

<p>olap4j makes it possible to write an OLAP client without starting from scratch.
In addition to the MDX parser, and operations on the MDX parse tree, there is a
higher-level query model, which includes <b>operations to transform queries</b>
(also called 'navigations'), and facilities to layout multidimensional results as HTML tables.</p>

<h3>1.3. <a name="Relationship to other standards">Relationship to other
standards</a></h3>
<h4>1.3.1. <a name="olap4j_and_XML/A">olap4j and XML/A</a></h4>

<p>At this point, you may be saying: what about XML/A? XML/A was here first, is an
open standard, and is supported by a number of servers. Is olap4j an attempt to
replace XML/A? Isn't XML/A good enough for everyone?</p>

<p>olap4j certainly has some similarities with XML/A. Both APIs allow an application to execute OLAP queries, and to browse the metadata of an OLAP schema. But XML/A is a
low-level web-services API which leaves a lot of work to the application writer.
(Witness the fact that the majority of successful XML/A applications run only on
Windows, where the ADOMD.NET is a high-level interface to XML/A servers.)
The APIs are mostly complementary, because olap4j can be easily
added to an XML/A back-end, and provides features which would be difficult or
impossible to provide via a web-services API. These are functions for parsing MDX, building and transforming MDX query models, and mapping result sets into
graphical layouts such as pivot tables.</p>

<p>If a web-services based application needs these functions, it can use the
XML/A provider to connect to the underlying data source, execute queries, and
browse metadata, but can still use olap4j's features for MDX parsing, query
models and layout.</p>
<h4>1.3.2. <a name="olap4j_is_built_on_other_standards">olap4j is built on other
standards</a></h4>
<p>Where possible, olap4j leverages existing standards. This has several
advantages. First, an end-user familiar with the existing standards can come up
to speed with olap4j quickly. For instance, creating a connection and executing
a statement should be straightforward to anyone familiar with JDBC connections,
statements and result sets work.</p>
<p>If an OLAP server implementor has already implemented a driver for one
standard, then it should be less work to implement an olap4j driver. This
clearly applies to the MDX language (borrowed from XML/A and OLE DB for OLAP).
Implementation schema result sets should be straightforward if the server
already supports XML/A schema rowsets.</p>
<p>If olap4j is sufficiently similar to an existing standard, tools designed for
use with that standard may be applicable to olap4j also. For instance, one goal
of olap4j is that people will be able to use connection-pooling libraries such
as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/">Jakarta Commons DBCP</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0">C3P0</a>. (This presents some
challenges because olap4j extends some of the JDBC interfaces, but we hope to
solve them.)</p>
<p>Lastly, reusing an existing standard is less work for the authors of the new
standard!</p>
<p>Sometimes the standards conflict. ADOMD exposes its metadata through an
object model, whereas JDBC and XML/A expose metadata relationally, via what
XML/A calls rowsets and what we and JDBC call result sets. In this case, we
chose to do both, because of the diversity of needs of olap4j clients. Metadata
objects allow you to integrate query results with metadata using much fewer
code: positions can reference members, and you can navigate from a member to its
hierarchy, and so forth. Likewise, metadata objects can be used in building MDX
parse trees. But if a client tool wants to maintain its own metadata cache,
schema rowsets are more flexible and efficient.</p>

<h3>1.4. <a name="Benefits_of_a_standard_Java_API_for_OLAP">Benefits of a standard Java API for OLAP</a></h3>

<p>Once the olap4j standard is in place, we can expect that the familiar
benefits of an open standard will emerge: a larger variety of tools, better
tools, and more price/feature competition between OLAP servers. These benefits
follow because if a developer of OLAP tool can reach a larger audience, there is greater
incentive to build new tools.</p>

<p>Eventually there will be olap4j providers for most OLAP servers. The server
vendors will initially have little incentive to embrace a standard which will
introduce competition into their market, but eventually the wealth of tools will
compel them to write a provider; or, more likely, will tempt third-party or
open-source efforts to build providers for their servers.</p>

<h3>1.5. <a name="Architecture_of_olap4j">Architecture of olap4j</a></h3>

2.1. <a name="Driver_management">Driver management</a></h3>

<p>olap4j shares JDBC's driver management facilities. This allows olap4j clients
to leverage the support for JDBC such as
connection pooling, driver registration.</p>

<p>Classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a class="javadoc" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Driver.html">java.sql.Driver</a></li>

</ul>

<h4>2.1.1. <a name="Driver">Driver</a></h4>
<p>Same functionality as JDBC.</p>
<p>Here is an example of registering an olap4j driver:</p>
<div class="code">
	Class.forName(&quot;mondrian.olap4j.Driver&quot;);</div>
<h4>2.1.2. <a name="DriverManager">DriverManager</a></h4>
<p>Same functionality as JDBC.</p>
<h4>2.1.3. <a name="DataSource">DataSource</a></h4>
<p>Same functionality as JDBC.</p>

<h3>2.2. <a name="Connections">Connections</a></h3>

<p>olap4j's connection management component manages connections to the OLAP server,
statements.</p>

<p>Where possible, olap4j uses JDBC's session management facility. olap4j defines extensions to
JDBC interfaces Connection and Statement.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For example, the following code registers a driver, connects to Mondrian and
executes a statement:</p>


  <div class="code">
	import org.olap4j.*;<br>
  <br>
  Class.forName(&quot;mondrian.olap4j.Driver&quot;);<br>
  	OlapConnection connection = (OlapConnection)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DriverManager.createConnection(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;jdbc:mondrian:local:Jdbc=jdbc:odbc:MondrianFoodMart;&quot;
  +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Catalog=/WEB-INF/queries/FoodMart.xml;&quot;
  +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Role='California manager'&quot;);<br>
  	OlapStatement statement = connection.createOlapStatement();<br>
  <br>
  OlapResult result =<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement.execute(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SELECT {[Measures].[Unit Sales]} ON
  COLUMNS,\n&quot; +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; {[Product].Members} ON
  ROWS\n&quot; +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;FROM [Sales]&quot;);</div>

<p>Here's a piece of code to connect to Microsoft SQL Server Analysis
Services&#8482; (MSAS) via XML/A. Note that besides the driver class and connect
string, the code is identical.</p>

<div class="code">
	import org.olap4j.*;<br><br>Class.forName(&quot;olap4j.impl.xmla.Driver&quot;);<br>OlapConnection connection = (OlapConnection)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DriverManager.createConnection(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;jdbc:olap4jxmla:Server=http://localhost/xmla/msxisapi.dll;&quot;
  +<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Catalog=FoodMart&quot;);<br>OlapStatement statement = connection.createOlapStatement();<br>
	<br>OlapResultSet result =<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement.execute(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;SELECT {[Measures].[Unit Sales]} ON
  COLUMNS,\n&quot; +<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; {[Product].Members} ON
  ROWS\n&quot; +<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;FROM [Sales]&quot;);</div>

<p>In the above examples, a statement was created from a string. As we shall
see, a statement can also be created from an MDX parse tree.</p>

<p>Package name: <a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/overview-summary.html">org.olap4j</a></p>

<h4>2.2.1.&nbsp;<a name="OlapConnection">OlapConnection</a><p>
<a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/OlapConnection.html">OlapConnection</a>&nbsp; (extends
<a class="javadoc" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html">
java.sql.Connection</a>) is a
connection to an OLAP data source.</p>
<h4>2.2.2. <a name="Connection_pooling">Connection pooling</a></h4>
<p>Look again at the code samples in the previous section. One would expect that it would be safe to downcast the result of a factory
method to the desired result. For example, if you invoke an <code>OlapConnection</code>'s
<code>createStatement()</code> method, the result should be an <code>
OlapStatement</code>.</p>
<p>But if you you are using a connection-pooling
library (common examples of which include <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/">Jakarta Commons DBCP</a> 
and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0">C3P0</a>), this is not so. Every
connection-pooling library tracks connections by wrapping them in another class,
and this class will implement <code>java.sql.Connection</code> but not <code>
OlapConnection</code>. To access methods of the <code>OlapConnection</code>, the
client application must first strip away the wrapper object.</p>
<p>If you are using a connection-pooling library, olap4j provides a helper class to access the object underneath a wrapped 
connection, statement, prepared statement or result set. For instance,</p>

<div class="code">DataSource dataSource; // a data source using a connection 
	pool<br>
  	Connection connection =<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DriverManager.createConnection(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;jdbc:mondrian:local:Jdbc=jdbc:odbc:MondrianFoodMart;&quot;
  +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Catalog=/WEB-INF/queries/FoodMart.xml;&quot;
  +<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Role='California manager'&quot;);<br>
	OlapConnection olapConnection = Olap4j.convert(connection);<br>
  	OlapStatement statement = olapConnection.createOlapStatement();</div>

<p>The
<a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/Olap4j.html#convert(java.sql.Connection)">
Olap4j.convert(Connection)</a> method returns an <code>OlapConnection</code>. It 
works with common connection pools, and the resulting object is instrumented so 
that any statements or prepared statements created from that connection also 
work with the connection pool. </p>
<p>The problem does not just affect connections: some connection pools also wrap
<code>Statement</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code>, <code>ResultSet</code>
and <code>DatabaseMetaData</code> objects, so there are <code>convert()</code> 
methods for these too.</p>
<p>Hopefully this problem will only be temporary. As olap4j gains popularity, we 
expect connection pools to add support for the extended interfaces, and it will 
be sufficient merely to cast the objects returned from factory methods.</p>

<h4>2.3.1. <a name="OlapStatement">OlapStatement</a></h4>
<p><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/OlapStatement.html">OlapStatement</a>&nbsp; (extends

produces.</p>
<h4>2.3.2. <a name="PreparedOlapStatement">PreparedOlapStatement</a></h4>
<p><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/PreparedOlapStatement.html">PreparedOlapStatement</a>
(extends
<a class="javadoc" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html">
java.sql.PreparedStatement</a>) represents a precompiled MDX statement.</p>
<p>An MDX statement is precompiled and stored in a <code>PreparedOlapStatement</code>
object. This object can then be used to efficiently execute this statement
multiple times.</p>
<p>The method
<a class="javadoc" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html#getParameterMetaData()">
PreparedStatement.getParameterMetaData()</a> returns a description of the
parameters, as in JDBC. The result is an OlapParameterMetaData.</p>
<p>To set values of parameters, use the <code>set<i>Type</i>(int, <i>type</i>)</code>
methods. If a parameter is a member, use the <code>setObject(int, Object)</code>
method; throws an exception if the object is not a member, or is a member of the
wrong hierarchy.</p>
<p>Unlike JDBC, it is not necessary to assign a value to every parameter. This
is because OLAP parameters have a default value. Parameters have their default
value until they are set, and then retain their new values for each subsequent
execution of this <code>PreparedOlapStatement</code>.</p>

<h3>2.4. <a name="MDX_query_model">MDX query model</a></h3>

<p>The MDX query model represents a parsed MDX statement. </p>

<p>An MDX query model can be created in three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The MDX parser parses an MDX string to create an MDX query model;</li>
  <li>Client code programmatically builds a query model by calling API methods;</li>
  <li>Code in the transform package manipulates query model in response to
  graphical operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>An MDX query model can exist in an <i>unvalidated</i> and <i>validated</i>
state. In the unvalidated state, identifiers and function calls exist as raw
strings, and no type information has been assigned. During validation,
identifiers are resolved to specific MDX objects (members, etc.), type
information is assigned, and if a function exists in several overloaded forms, a
specific instance is chosen based upon the types of its arguments.</p>

<p>Any MDX query model can be serialized to a string containing MDX text.</p>

<p>An MDX query model can be converted into a statement. For example,</p>

<div class="code">

  // Create a query model.<br>
  OlapConnection connection;<br>
  Query query = new Query();<br>
  query.setFrom(&quot;Sales&quot;);<br>
  query.getAxes().add(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new Axis(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;ROWS&quot;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; false,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new UnresolvedFunCall(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;{}&quot;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Syntax.Special,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new Id(new
  String[] {&quot;Measures&quot;, &quot;Unit Sales&quot;})));<br>
  <br>
  // Create a statement based upon the query model.<br>
  OlapStatement stmt;<br>
  try {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stmt = connection.createOlapStatement(query);<br>
  } catch (OlapException e) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(&quot;Validation failed: &quot; + e);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return;<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  // Execute the statement.<br>
  ResultSet rset;<br>
  try {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rset = stmt.execute();<br>
  } catch (OlapException e) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(&quot;Execution failed: &quot; + e);<br>
  }</div>

<h3>2.5. <a name="MDX_type_model">MDX type model</a></h3>

<p>Package name: <code>org.olap4j.mdx.type</code></p>

<p>Represents the types of nodes in an MDX query model.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Expression</th>
		<th>Type</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>1 + 2</code></td>
		<td>Integer</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>[Store]</code></td>
		<td>Dimension</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>[Store].[State]</code></td>
		<td>Level&lt;dimension=[Store], hierarchy=[Store]&gt;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>[Store].[USA].[CA]</code></td>
		<td>Member&lt;dimension=[Store], hierarchy=[Store], level=[Store].[State],
      member=[Store].[USA].[CA]&gt;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>[Store].[USA].Children(2)</code></td>
		<td>Member&lt;dimension=[Store], hierarchy=[Store], level=[Store].[State]&gt;</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Since MDX is a late-binding language, some expressions will have unknown
types, or only partial type information. For example, the expression</p>

<div class="code">

  	[Store].Levels(&quot;Sta&quot; + &quot;te&quot;)</div>

<p>will have type <code>Level&lt;dimension=[Store], level=unknown&gt;</code>. The
validator knows that the <code>&lt;hierarchy&gt;.Levels(&lt;string expr&gt;)</code> function
returns a level, but exactly which level is not known until the expression is
evaluated at runtime.</p>
<p><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/Type.html">Type</a> is the base class for all types.</p>
<p>Scalar types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/ScalarType.html">ScalarType</a> represents the type of an expression which has a
	simple value such as a number or a string.</li>

	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/DecimalType.html">
	DecimalType</a> (extends <code>NumericType</code>) represents a fixed-point numeric expression. It
	is a subclass of <code>NumericType</code>, and has precision and scale. An
	integer expression would have scale 0.</li>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/StringType.html">StringType</a> (extends <a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/ScalarType.html">ScalarType</a>) represents the type of an expression which has a string
	value.</li>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/SymbolType.html">SymbolType</a> (extends ScalarType) represents the type of a
	symbol, or flag, argument to a builtin function. For example, the <code>ASC</code>
	keyword in the expression <code>Order(Gender.MEMBERS, Measures.[Unit Sales],
	ASC)</code> is a symbol. Symbol types are rarely used except if you are
	manipulating a parse tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Metadata types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/CubeType.html">CubeType</a> represents the type of an expression whose value
	is a cube.</li>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/DimensionType.html">
	DimensionType</a> represents the type of an expression whose
	value is a dimension.</li>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/HierarchyType.html">
	HierarchyType</a> represents the type of an expression whose
	value is a hierarchy.</li>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/LevelType.html">LevelType</a> represents the type of an expression whose value

	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/MemberType.html">MemberType</a> represents the type of an expression whose value
	is a member.</li>
</ul>
<p>A metadata type may be constrained to a particular part of the schema. For
example, <code>LevelType(hierarchy=[Time])</code> indicates that the expression
must evaluate to one of the levels of the <code>[Time]</code> hierarchy, that
is, one of the values <code>[Time].[Year]</code>, <code>[Time].[Quarter]</code>,
or <code>[Time].[Month]</code>.</p>
<p>Composite types</p>
<ul>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/SetType.html">SetType</a> represents the type of an expression which is a
	set. It has a component type, for example, the type of the expression <code>
	{[Store].[USA].Children}</code> is <code>Set(Member(level=[Store].[Store
	State])</code>.</li>
	<li><a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/type/TupleType.html">TupleType</a> represents the type of an expression which
	consists of an n-tuple of members. It has a set of component types, each of
	which is a member type. For example, the type of the expression <code>
	CrossJoin({[Gender].[F], [Gender].[M]}, [Store].Members)</code> is <code>
	Set(Tuple(Member(level=[Gender].[Gender]), Member(hierarchy=[Store]))</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6. <a name="Metadata">Metadata</a></h3>
<p>Package name:
<a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/metamodel/overview-summary.html">
org.olap4j.metamodel</a></p>
<p>Metadata are the objects which describe the structure of an OLAP schema:
cubes, dimensions, members, properties and so forth.</p>
<p>olap4j exposes metadata in two very different ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <dfn>metadata object</dfn> is a Java object which represents a particular
metadata class. For example, <a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/metadata/Cube.html">
org.olap4j.metadata.Cube</a>.</li>
	<li>A <dfn>schema result set</dfn> is a JDBC ResultSet which returns a record
	for each instance of a particular metadata class. There is a method in
	OlapDatabaseMetaData to create a schema rowset for each metadata class. Some
	of these methods accept parameters to filter the rows returned. For example,
	<a class="javadoc" href="api/org/olap4j/OlapDatabaseMetaData.html#getCubes(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">
	OlapDatabaseMetaData.getCubes(&lt;schemaName&gt;, &lt;cubeName&gt;)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.6.1. <a name="Access_control">Access control</a></h4>

<p>A user's view of metadata may be subject to access control. For example, a
user may not have read access to certain hierarchies within a cube, or to
certain members within a hierarchy. The API methods must behave consistently
with access control.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Example</i>: If Fred does not have access to the <code>[Nation]</code>
	level of the <code>[Store]</code> hierarchy, then the <code>
	Member.getParentMember()</code> method will return null if applied to <code>
	[Store].[USA].[CA]</code>, because the 'real' parent member <code>[Store].[USA]</code>
	is invisible to him.</p>

<h3>2.8. <a name="Layout">Layout</a></h3>

<p>The layout package provides data models for graphical OLAP applications. In
particular, the GridModel class provides, for OLAP data, what Swing's
<a class="javadoc" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/table/TableModel.html">
TableModel</a> provides for SQL data.</p>

<p>Package name: <code>org.olap4j.layout</code></p>

<p>Classes: TBD</p>

<h2>3. <a name="Other_components">Other components</a></h2>

<p>The API described above is a set of interfaces which must be implemented by
any compliant provider. The olap4j project also contains some components which
are not part of the API.</p>

<h3>3.1. <a name="Test_suite">Test suite</a></h3>

<p>The olap4j project contains a TCK (Test Compatability Kit). The TCK is a suite
of tests which can be used to verify the compliance of an implementation of the
API.</p>

<h3>3.2. <a name="XML/A_provider">XML/A provider</a></h3>

<p>The XML/A provider is an implementation of the olap4j API which talks to a
generic XML/A provider.</p>

<p>Since there are many XML/A providers, and some of them require requests in a
particular format and/or produce idiosyncratic responses, the XML/A provider
will come in several flavors.</p>

<h2>4. <a name="Non-functionality">Non-functionality</a></h2>

<p>Here are some of the areas of functionality which will <i>not</i> be part of
the olap4j project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Schema reader parses an XML file to create a schema</li>
  <li>Cache management functions </li>
  <li>Ability to create/modify schema dynamically</li>
  <li>Definitions of MDX functions</li>
  <li>SPI to extend the system by creating user-defined functions and so forth</li>
  <li>XML/A bridge (to make an olap4j data source appear as an XML/A server)</li>
  <li>SchemaReader</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. <a name="Related_projects">Related projects</a></h2>

<h3>5.1. <a name="Mondrian_provider">Mondrian provider</a></h3>

<p>The Mondrian project will contain an implementation of the olap4j API based on
the Mondrian OLAP server.</p>

<h3>5.2. <a name="JPivot">JPivot</a></h3>

<p>JPivot currently based on two data sources: the Mondrian server, and a
generic XML/A data source.</p>

<p>We intend to convert JPivot to run solely on the olap4j API. Connectivity to
Mondrian and XML/A sources will be achieved by choosing the appropriate olap4j
provider. </p>

<h3>5.3. <a name="Other_data_sources">Other data sources</a></h3>

<p>In principle, providers could be created to other OLAP data sources. This
would be particularly straightforward for servers which already have a native
Java API.</p>

<h2>Appendix A. <a name="Opportunities_for_specification">Opportunities for specification</a></h2>

<p>The following are features which have been suggested for inclusion in the
olap4j specification, but which are not part of the current version. They may be
included in future revisions of the specification.</p>

<h3>A.1. Date and Time types</h3>

<p>Include support for Date and Time values. The package org.olap4j.mdx.type
could have additional classes DateType and TimeType.</p>

<p>(Richard Emberson, 2006/8/14)</p>

<h3>A.2. Schema notification</h3>

<p>Add a mechanism for the client to detect that the schema has been modified
(for instance, that a cube has been added). Not necessarily to find out what
those changes are.</p>

<p>(Richard Emberson, 2006/8/15)</p>
<h3>A.3. Writethrough/Writeback</h3>
<p>Specify how clients can write cell values back to the database. Useful for
budgeting applications and 'what if?' analysis.</p>
<p>(PALO, 2006/10/14)</p>

<h2>Appendix B. <a name="Feedback">Feedback</a></h2>

<h3>Richard Emberson, email, 2006/8/15</h3>

<p>&quot;One thing we found about XMLA was that our users wanted all roles to be 
defined, stored, modified, and accessed though the same mechanism. With a large 
application with many areas that can be permissioned, it is important that 
olap4j let an application builder manage roles externally and apply them as part 
of an individual's execution context.&quot;</p>

<h2>Appendix C. <a name="Open_issues">Open issues</a></h2>

<p>These issues will be voted upon at the next meeting. If they are accepted, 
they will generally be put into the spec.</p>
